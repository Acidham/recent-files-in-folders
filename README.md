# Recent Files In Folders
Alfred Workflow to get recent files in folders

Shows recent files in a folder and opens the file, reveal in Finder (CMD), share via Dropbox (ALT) (requires WF http://www.packal.org/workflow/drop) or by applying file actions on the file.

* CMD on a folder provides the ability to delete all files in a folder.
* A Custom string format can be set in *date_format* workflow value (Format cheat sheet: http://strftime.org/)
* If `search_subfolders` is set to `True` the subfolders in the directory will be read as well. If set to `False` Subfolders will be ignored.

custom folders can be set in List Filter relative to home directory e.g. Desktop or Desktop/somefolder or absolute path
